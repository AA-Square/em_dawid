# Description #

This project provides an implementation of the probabilistic consensus model described by Dawid et al.(1979) allowing for the aggregation of multiple ratings. It is written  in R and in the source directory, we provide a walk-through explanation of the model formulation and parameters estimation using the same notation and workflow of the original paper.
